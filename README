WHAT IS THIS?
#############

This is a first attempt to create a framework that helps deploy and debug an
android system and apps in multiple android devices.

It also has the flexibility of working with external projects that are not
included/integrated in the AOSP.

It was born as a set of scripts that help build and flash the Android
images on the phones, but it's moving to something more serious and useful.
Therefore it is still under heavy development.
